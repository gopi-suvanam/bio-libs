### Specification Document: JavaScript Libraries for Bioinformatics

**Objective**:  
To design and implement a suite of JavaScript libraries for bioinformatics to facilitate data analysis, modeling, and visualization using a modern, web-based scientific computation tool, Scribbler.

#### **1. Overview**

Bioinformatics analysis often requires robust tools for handling complex datasets such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq), bulk RNA sequencing, and gene regulatory networks. While Python and R dominate the field, there is an opportunity to develop JavaScript-based libraries that enable bioinformatics computation within web environments, leveraging tools like Scribbler for accessibility and collaboration.

#### **2. Key Functional Requirements**

**Core Analysis Functions**:  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce dimensionality for large datasets.  
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Include K-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based methods for grouping genes/cells.  
- **Statistical Tests**:  
  - Parametric: T-tests, ANOVA.  
  - Non-parametric: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Mann-Whitney U test.  
  - Pairwise comparisons and enrichment analysis.

**Visualization**:  
- 2D/3D scatterplots for PCA and clustering results.  
- Heatmaps for gene expression.  
- Network graphs for gene regulatory networks.  

**Data Handling**:  
- Support for large datasets via streaming and chunking.  
- Interoperability with standard bioinformatics file formats (FASTQ, SAM/BAM, CSV).  
- Integration with existing pipelines and platforms like Nextflow.

**Specialized Bioinformatics Tools**:  
- Gene Regulatory Network Analysis: Build and visualize relationships between genes.  
- Differential Gene Expression: Identify genes upregulated or downregulated under specific conditions.  
- Co-expression Analysis: Detect genes expressed together.

#### **3. Technical Requirements**

**Core Technologies**:  
- JavaScript (ES6+).  
- Scribbler as the notebook platform for interactive computation.  

**Dependencies and Libraries**:  
- Math.js for numerical computations.  
- Plotly.js for data visualization.  
- TensorFlow.js for machine learning and neural network models.  
- BioJS for bioinformatics-specific tools (e.g., genome browsers).  

**Integration**:  
- API endpoints for data retrieval (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).  
- Compatibility with GitHub-hosted algorithms/scripts for extending functionality.
- GPU acceleration using WebGPU or WebGL for computationally heavy tasks.

#### **4. Collaborative Features**

- **Notebook Integration**: Develop bioinformatics workflows as shareable, interactive Scribbler notebooks.  
- **AI Assistance**: Integration of Scribbler's AI assistant for code suggestions and optimization during bioinformatics analysis.  
- **Hackathon-Friendly**: Provide boilerplate libraries and datasets to facilitate quick adoption and experimentation during hackathons.  

---

#### **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **User-Friendliness**: Simplify interfaces for experimental biologists with minimal coding experience.  
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of datasets with millions of rows.  
- **Open Source**: Libraries to be made freely available on GitHub with clear documentation and tutorials.

#### **6. Development Roadmap**

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Collaborate with biologists to list specific algorithms and workflows in demand.  
2. **Boilerplate Development**: Create foundational libraries for PCA, clustering, and visualization.  
3. **Prototype Tools**: Develop gene regulatory network analysis and differential expression modules.  
4. **Testing**: Validate with real-world datasets shared by collaborators (e.g., scRNASeq, bulk RNA sequencing).  
5. **Hackathon Implementation**: Organize a hackathon to crowdsource ideas and test the libraries in practical workflows.  
6. **Release**: Publish libraries and tutorials on GitHub.
